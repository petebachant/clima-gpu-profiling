The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 57 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, this partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total runtime of this kernel. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid.
